This is my AWESOME WEBSITE and i made it with WEB.PY. Screw Flask And heres why:

Sqlite library is shit and no one knows how touse it
Sqlite library documentation doesnt help either
Cant use it for larger projects (even a SMALL FUCKING SNS)
Makes me want to vomit

Why you should use WEBPY:

Sql support and documentation that doesnt make me want to jump off a bridge
Cookbook and reference that actually explains what the hell im looking at
